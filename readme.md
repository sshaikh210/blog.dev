MVC Blog

This is my blog written in PHP, JS, jQuery, and CSS on the Laravel framework.

## Getting Started
- Clone this repository
- Create a database for this application
- Create a '.env.local.php' file inside of 'blog.dev/'
- Add the contents of 'env-template.php' to '.env.local.php'
- Add your database logins to the values
- Run 'composer install'

The project is built using a Model-VIew-Controller architecture.
